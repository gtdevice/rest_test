Please create an application that exposes at least two http endpoints to manage a superhero entity (Object Schema and examples provided below). 

{
    alias: 'Captain Marvel',
    name: 'Carol Danvers',
    powers: ['photon-blast', 'flight', 'super-strength', 'healing'],
    weapons: [],
    origin: 'Exposed to Space Stone reactor overload',
    associations: ['space-stone', 'skrulls', 'photon', 'kree', 'avengers']
}

{
    alias: 'Iron Man',
    name: 'Tony Stark',
    powers: ['genius-intelligence', 'wealth'],
    weapons: ['arc-reactor', 'iron-man-suit', 'iron-legion'],
    origin: 'Kidnapped in Afghanistan, created the first iron-man suit to escape.',
    associations: ['war-machine', 'avengers', 'jarvis', 'thanos', 'pepper-potts']
}

Use this as a showcase of your capabilities. We are looking for well structured, well designed and easy to extend code. 

At a minimum
You should be able to create new instances of the entity.
You should be able to retrieve instances of the entity,
This application should be packaged into a docker container with instructions on how to run the application and any details of any assumptions you have made to be provided in a README.md file.

Feel free to add any elements you feel would benefit this application in a real world use case.

Set up a private Git repository (do constant, small commits), and in the end git bundle
it and share it with us in a zip file.
